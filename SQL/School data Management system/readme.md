## _This is simple School database management system made by [me](https://github.com/Infinitymaths) with the help of PYTHON and SQL, in order to understand the basic funcionalities of SQL and also to check the Integration of SQL and python_

## Required libraries and other things
- [mysql-python-connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/connector-python/8.0/installation.html) - MySQL connector library for python
- [MySQL] Installed and Configured 

## How to install the requirements
There is a file named as _requirements.txt_, so just download it and then open _powershell_ and type **_pip install -r requirements.txt_**


## How to Run :
- Clone the source code folder into your system
- Run the launch.py file 
- Enter the valid credentials of MySQL and you are good to go ðŸ‘Œ

This is data managemnet system providing basic functions as follows

- Register 
  - To enter the Data of new Student in Database
- login
  - To fetch the data from Database
 
 _If chosen login, a menu will be provided as follows_
 
 ## Menu 
 1. Create a New Student Record.
 2. Update the course of a particular student
 3. Student Details
 4. Course Details
 5. Delete Record
 6. Quit

## Important Things I wish to inform
- This is very basic project which was designed for practicing the integration of PYTHON and SQL(But not that basic, since logging and other functionalities is also addedâœŒ). It does not have very much advanced features like 
  - Proper integration like different tables for different things like student details, Course details,Marks obtained, etc.
  - Then some rules for the phone number,email, etc.
  - GUI or website integration like for a Frontend
  - etc. 
## So, Run the code in your system. Learn things. Modify as per your liking and Enjoy âœ¨!!
## Please do give a _STAR_
